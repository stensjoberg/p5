# Under Door Tool

## Materials

- 1x wire coat hanger
- 1x set of pliers
- 4 feet (120 cm) of heavy-duty string

## Instructions

1. Straighten the coat hanger into a wire.
2. On one end, bend a section of the wire approximately the width of your palm by 90 degrees.
3. On the same end, make a second 90 degree bend about 4 inches (10 cm) after the first bend to create a U-shape.
4. On the other end of the wire, bend the wire into itself to create a small loop.
5. On the same end, bend the wire inward about 3 inches (7.5 cm) to create a U-shape along with the handle.
6. Attach a string to the loop on the far end of the wire.

## Usage instructions

1. Slip the entire tool through the slit under the door.
2. Raise the tool by turning the handle.
3. Guide the top of the tool to the lever handle.
4. When you can feel that the tool is resting on the lever, pull hard on the string to engage the lever and unlock the door.
5. Push or pull to open the door.
