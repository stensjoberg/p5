# The Public Physical Pentesting Paraphernalia Project (P5) 

The Public Physical Pentesting Paraphernalia Project (P5) is a collection of 3D printing models, DIY tool instructions and entry-level methodologies for lowering the entry barrier to physical penetration testing.


## What is physical peneration testing?

Simply put, physical penetration testing (or pentesting) is the practice of attempting to break into physical buildings in order to assess the building's security. As an introduction, I highly recommend Deviant Ollam's talk [I'll Let Myself In: Tactics of Physical Penetration Pen Testers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnmcRTnTNC8).

## What is the purpose of this project?

Physical penetration testing, although usually more intuitive than regular (computer) penetration testing, has a higher barrier to entry due to the lack of Open Source tools and information. This is a project to attempt to change that for the better.

In this project you will find several models for 3D-printed paraphernalia related to physical pentesting, as well as instructions on how to use them. There are also instructions for how to DIY together useful tools for testing.

## 3D Printing Models

### Defensive

- [Anti-UDT Shroud](models/anti-udt-shroud/)
- [Security Door Wedge](models/security-door-wedge/) 

### Offensive

- [Double Door Tool](models/double-door-tool/)
- [Hinge Removal Aid](models/hinge-removal-aid/)

### Printing instructions

All models supplied are of the STL file format. Simply download the file you want to print, run it through a slicer and print it. In each model directory, there is a readme file with details about the model, such as usage, assembly and specific printing instructions.

## DIY Tool Guides
